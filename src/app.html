        Upon the death of <b>Lord Jon Arryn</b>, the principal advisor to King Robert Baratheon, Robert recruits his
        childhood
        friend Eddard <q>Ned</q> Stark, now Warden of the North, to replace Arryn as Hand of the King, and to betroth
        his
        daughter Sansa to Robert's son Joffrey. Ned accepts the position when he learns that Arryn's widow Lysa believes
        he was poisoned by Robert's wife Queen Cersei Lannister and her family. Shortly thereafter, Ned's son Bran
        discovers <i>Cersei having sex with her twin brother</i> <b>Jaime Lannister</b>, who throws Bran from the tower
        to conceal
        their affair, leaving him comatose and paralyzing his legs.
