        Bugs Bunny is a beloved animated character created by Warner Bros. He is
        best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie
        Melodies series of animated short films. Bugs is a clever, quick-witted
        rabbit who often outsmarts his adversaries, including Elmer Fudd, Daffy
        Duck, and Yosemite Sam. With his iconic catchphrase, "What's up, Doc?",
        Bugs Bunny has become a cultural icon and a favorite among audiences of
        all ages.
