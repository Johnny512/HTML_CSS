    <!--star with main text-->

    <p>
        Olafur Eliasson was born in Copenhagen Denmark in 1967 to Icelandic
        parents.
    </p>
    <p>
        He is known for sculptures and large-scale installation of art employing
        elemental materials such as light, water, and air temperature to enhance
        the viewer's experience.
    </p>
    <!--end of main text-->

        Water and air. So very commonplace are these substances, they hardly
        attract attention - and yet they vouchsafe our very existence.
